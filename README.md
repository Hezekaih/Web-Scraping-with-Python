# Web-Scraping-with-Python
In this project I'll be using Python to connect to Google Trends API using Pytrends for webscraping, iterate the data collection over the list of keywords and integrate them using a keyword as reference, while visualizing the results with Pandas and Matplotlib. The Keywords are: Business Analysis, Data Science, Data Analysis between January 25-2021 and January 25-2022 in Nigeria.
### Aknowledgement
Before going through this analysis, I'd really appreciate one of my mentor Jonathan Ogwumike. He really motivates me to go on and do more projects with python.

The pytrends API has about nine methods. For this project I’ll be using the following:

- Interest Over Time: returns historical, indexed data for when the keyword was searched most as shown on Google Trends’ Interest Over Time section.
- Interest by Region: returns data for where the keyword is most searched as shown on Google Trends’ Interest by Region section.
- Related Queries: returns data for the related keywords to a provided keyword shown on Google Trends’ Related Queries section.
- Suggestions: returns a list of additional suggested keywords that can be used to refine a trend search.
